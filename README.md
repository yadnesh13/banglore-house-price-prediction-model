House Price Prediction Model for Bangalore Area
This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bangalore using a linear regression model. The model is built on Jupyter Notebook, utilizing Python for data processing, analysis, and model creation. Additionally, a server-side implementation manages the model, while the client-side offers a user-friendly interface for predictions.

Files Structure
Jupyter Notebook: The notebook files contain the logic and development process of the house price prediction model.

Bangalore_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb: Detailed development of the linear regression model.
model: Folder containing the serialized model in a pickle file (bangalore_house_price_model.pkl).
server: The server-side implementation is written in Python, managing the model and handling prediction requests.

app.py: Python script creating the server and implementing API endpoints for model prediction.
client: This folder contains the front-end components for user interaction.

index.html: HTML file for the user interface.
style.css: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling the HTML elements.
script.js: JavaScript file for handling user interactions and making requests to the server for predictions.
data: This directory holds supplementary data files.

locations.json: JSON file listing all the locations within Bangalore.
Usage
Model Development:

Open Bangalore_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to explore the model creation process.
Model Serialization:

After model development, the finalized model is saved as bangalore_house_price_model.pkl in the model folder.
Server Setup and Execution:

Navigate to the server directory and execute app.py to start the server using Python.
Client Interface:

Open index.html in a web browser to access the user interface.
Select a location from the provided list in the interface and input other necessary details to get the predicted house price.
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (3.x)
Jupyter Notebook
Flask (for server-side implementation)
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for client-side functionality
Notes
The model's accuracy may vary based on the data and features used. It's recommended to explore feature engineering and other model improvements for better predictions.
Location options for predictions are available in the locations.json file under the data directory.
Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or report issues through pull requests or by raising an issue in the repository.
